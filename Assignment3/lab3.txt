Assignment 3: Modifying and rewriting software

Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package

1. $ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
   $ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
   $ wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
   Grabbed the Coreutils 8.29 source code compressed tarball, signature
   and GNU keyring.

   $ gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
   Verify the signature with the GNU keyring
   Problems:
	WARNING: options in `/u/eng/class/classvwt/.gnupg/gpg.conf' are not yet
	active during this run
	WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
   These warnings occur because it is a public key and it has not been verified
   by the user.

2. $ tar -xvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
   Used tar command to unzip the Coreutils file, the option -x meaning extract
   the files. -f creates a new directory with all these files called
   coreutils-8.29

   $ cd coreutils-8.29
   enter the coreutils directory

   $ nano INSTALL
   View the INSTALL file to read how the instructions on how to install

   $ ./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classvwt/coreutilsLab3
   This configures the package, creating a Makefile in each directory in the
   package. We include a prefix flag with an absolute path for the installation
   location.

   $ make
   We run the make command to compile the package

   $ make install
   This installs the package and creates a directory called coreutilsLab3 in
   my home directory (absolute path: /u/eng/class/classvwt/coreutilsLab3, or
   relative path ~/coreutilsLab3)

   There were no problems encountered during this step

3. $ ~/coreutilsLab3/bin/ls -aA
   We run the installed ls command to try to reproduce the bug. When running
   this command with the -aA options, we see that the -a overrides the -A as my
   directory contents were shown, including . and .. along with other files
   beginning with a . so the bug is still present.

4. $ cd coreutils-8.29
   Enter the coreutils directory

   $ emacs patch.diff
   Created a new file, "patch.diff" that will be our patch file where we copy
   and paste the patch from Bug#30963 Message #10.

   Copy and pasted the patch file from the website and then used
   C-x C-s C-x C-c to save and exit the new file.

   $ patch -p1 < patch.diff
   This applies the patch with the flag p1 to strip the smallest prefix
   containing 1 leading slash from each file name found in the patch file

   There were no problems encountered during this step

5. $ autoreconf -f -i
   Update our make configurations to prepare to compile the patched package
   with make again.

   $ make
   Now we run make at the highest level in our coreutils-8.29 directory.
   Since we have already called the make command before, this time around it
   only has to compile files that are related to the patch so less commands are
   executed.

   $ make install
   Installs the package

6. $ ~/coreutilsLab3/bin/ls -aA
   Test the newly modified command to see if the -A overrides the -a.
   Output:
   coreutils-8.29	  coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig	lab3.txt
   coreutils-8.29.tar.xz  gnu-keyring.gpg

   There is no . or .. outputted so we can see that the bug has been fixed
