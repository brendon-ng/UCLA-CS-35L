Assignment 8: SSH setup and use in applications

Laboratory:

Set Up Beaglebone:

1. Plug in Beaglebone
2. Open START.htm page from Beaglebone directory on my laptop
3. Installed the two drivers including 9.2 HoRNDIS because I am running a
   recent version of Mac OS. Then ran
   $ sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/HoRNDIS.kext
   and restarted my computer.

4. Then I SSH'ed into by BeagleBone:
   $ sudo ssh debian@192.168.6.2
   Since I have a very new BeagleBone, the password was not blank for root so I
   logged into Debian instead with the password "temppwd"

5. Connected it to wifi - used a personal wifi hotspot for this step.
   In the BeagleBone:
   $ sudo connmanctl
   connmanctl> enable wifi
   connmanctl> scan wifi
   connmanctl> services
   I then found the iPhone wifi hotspot and copied the access point.
   connmanctl> agent on
   connmanctl> connect
   Entered the password, was then connected successfully to wifi
   connmanctl> quit

6. Checked to find the IP address of my BeagleBone:
   $ ifconfig
   It outputted a lot of information but under the network interface "wlan0",
   there was a label "inet" with my IP address next to it.
   IP address: 172.20.10.2

7. Updated the database of apt-get:
   $ sudo apt-get update
   Installed xauth and xvfb for X11 forwarding support:
   $ sudo apt-get install xauth
   $ sudo apt-get install xvfb

8. Enable X11 forwarding
   $ sudo vim /etc/ssh/ssh_config
   Then I changed "ForwardX11 no" and "ForwardAgent no" to "ForwardX11 yes" and
   "ForwardAgent yes".
   $ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   Checked to make sure forwarding was on and it was.

   I already had XQuartz on my Mac so I did not have to do anyting for that.

9. Installed firefox:
   $ sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb
