Assignment 9: Change management

Homework: Verifying and publishing a backported change

1. $ emacs hw9.txt
   $ git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git diffutilshw
   Clone repo again so we are working with a clean slate

2. $ cd diffutils
   $ git checkout v3.0 -b quote
   Check out version 3.0 and create a new branch

3. $ patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt
   Install the changes into this branch

4. Researched EMACS function  add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a)

5. $ emacs
   C-x 4 a
   Pasted the change entries into the changelog from git-log.txt
   C-x C-s
   C-x C-c

6. $ git add .
   $ git commit -F ChangeLog
   Stage all changes and commit them to the new branch with the ChangeLog entry
   as the commit message.

7. $ git format-patch -1 --stdout > ../formatted-patch.txt
   Generate a formatted patch.

8. Partner: Jivan Gubbi
   UID: 604929653

   I got Jivan's formatted patch and named it jivan-formatted-patch.txt

   $ git checkout v3.0 -b partner
   $ git am < ../jivan-formatted-patch.txt
   $ ./bootstrap
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ make check

   We apply my partner's patch and build, verifying that the patch works with
   make check.

   We check the commands and make sure there is no backtick:
   $ ./src/diff . -
   Outputs:
   ./src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

   $ ./src/diff --help
   Outputs no backticks

9. $ make distdir
   $ cd diffutils-3.0.1-e3a1
   $ nano ChangeLog
   Verify that the ChangeLog entry works
   Jivan's CHangeLog entry was successfully on the top of the file

10. $ exit
    $ ssh -X classvwt@lnxsrv05.seas.ucla.edu
    Log out and ssh back in using -X to enable X11 forwarding

    $ cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
    $ gitk
    An XQuartz window opens on my computer and we look for the newest merge
    that is not newer tahn 1/25/15
    The description is in gitk-description.txt
    The merge I screenshotted was at 2015-01-25 12:19:27 by Joakim Verona
    with the comment "Merge branch 'master' into xwidget"
