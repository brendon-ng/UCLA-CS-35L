Assignment 1: Getting to Know Your System

Laboratory: Linux and Emacs scavenger hunt

1. [$ man -k "string"]
   This prints all commands that have the string specified by "string" in their man page. To find this, I used the command [$ man man] to find infomration on the man command.

2. mv is located at /usr/local/cs/bin/mv
   sh is located at /usr/bin/sh
   I used [$ which mv] and [$ which sh] to find these paths

3. All executable programs that have two character names ending in 'r' are
   pr - converts text files for printing
   ar - create, modify, and extract from archives
   tr - translate or delete characters
   I found these by using the command [$ find /usr/bin/ -name "?r" -executable]
   I found the functions by using [$ man pr], [$ man ar], and [$ man tr]

4. The file that is actually executed is /etc/alternatives/emacs
   I used the [$ readlink /usr/bin/emacs] command that prints the executed file from a symbolic link or canonical file name.

5. The version number of the /usr/bin/gcc program is 4.8.5
   The version number of the plain gcc program is 8.2.0
   They are different programs because they are in different directories and therefore, different files
   I used the command [$ /usr/bin/gcc --version] and [$ gcc --version] to find this

6. The first letter is who we are changing the permissions for, the symbol in the second spot is whether we are adding mode bits, causing them to be removed, or causing them to be added AND causing unmentioned bits to be removed, and the last letter selects file mode bits for the affected users
   u+sx means the user who owns the file gets added execute and set user or group ID on execution permissions
   o-w means other users not the owner or those in the file's group are removed of the permission to write.
   To find this out, I used [$ man chmod]

7. To find the all directories located under or in the same directory as /usr/local/cs that were modified in the last four weeks, I used the command [$ find /usr/local/cs -mtime -28 -type d]
   To learn how to do this, I used [$ man find]
   The -mtime -28 argument signifies searching for files modified in the last 28*24 hours. The -type d argument signifies searching for directories only.
   There were many directories found in the search, too many to list.

8. There are 252 symbolic links in the same directory as find
   I first used [$ whereis find] to get the location of find
   I then used [$ find /usr/bin -type l | wc -l] to find all symbolic links (type l) in that same directory and then count the number of new lines outputted.

9. The oldest file in the directory /usr/lib64 is librom1394.so.0.3.0 modified
   To find this, I used the command [$ ls -lta] where the argument 'l' uses a long listing format, the argument 't' sorts the list by modification time, and the argument 'a' makes sure files that begin with . are not ignored.

10. The data is from on the settings of the environment variables that control the locale.
    To find this, I read the description found with [$ man locale]

11. The commands with downcase in their name are:
    downcase-dwim
    downcase-region
    downcase-word
    I opened emacs and used the command [C-h a downcase]

12. C-M-r: isearch-backward-regexp: Do incremental search backward for regular expression.
    C-M-s: isearch-forward-regexp: Do incremental search forward for regular expression.
    C-M-t: transpose-sexps: Interchange symbolic expressions around point, moving forward one character. 
    C-M-u: backward-up-list: Move backward out of one level of parentheses.
    C-M-v: scroll-other-window: Scroll next window upward ARG lines; or near full screen if no ARG.
    To find these, I used the C-h k command that lets you search commands by their keystrokes.
    I used: [C-h k C-M-r], [C-h	k C-M-s], [C-h	k C-M-t], [C-h	k C-M-u], and [C-h	k C-M-v]

13. The	command	C-g runs the command keyboard-quit (found in global-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’. During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly. At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.
    To find this, I used [C-h k C-g]

14. The yank function Reinserts ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.
    It can be easily invoked using C-y
    I found this by using the command [C-h f] and using "yank" as the input
    [C-h f yank]

15. In emacs dired command is invoked by [C-x d] and it shows the items in the directory specified. It shows 297928 items and 13074856 of available space.
    The shell command [$ ls -l
